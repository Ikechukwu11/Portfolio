            From the commencement of my career in my home country Nigeria, as an
            Executive Trainee till date, I have continuously sought ways to add
            value to myself and develop myself professionally. This has helped
            me to upskill, re-skill, and remain relevant in the banking sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have attended over fifty seminars, workshops, and internal courses
            and have taken up voluntary roles that have aided my career growth.
            Some of the courses I undertook are as follows.

            strategies to manage legal hazards in banking transactions
            effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Credit School</b>: This course offered a comprehensive assessment
            of credit analysis, risk evaluation, and loan administration. I
            acquired knowledge of various loan categories, credit evaluation
            models, loan approval procedures, and techniques for effectively
            overseeing credit portfolios and minimizing credit hazards.

            me the knowledge and skills to proficiently promote banking products

            segmentation, digital marketing strategies, fostering relationships,
            and the concepts of personal branding.
          </p>

          <p>

            this training was to enhance my proficiency in negotiating and
            selling, both of which play a pivotal role in achieving favorable
            outcomes in client interactions and deal-making within the banking
            industry. I acquired knowledge of negotiating methods, communication
            strategies, and the art of effectively finalizing deals while
            upholding robust client relationships.
          </p>
          <p>

            various banking software and apps utilized in the business. I
            expanded my understanding of fundamental banking systems, payment
            processing platforms, mobile banking applications, and cutting-edge
            technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence in the
            banking sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Budgeting</b>: I learned about the fundamentals of budgeting and
            financial planning, applicable to personal and institutional
            settings. I acquired expertise in budget creation and management,
            financial performance predictions, and making well-informed
            financial decisions through budget analysis.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, I was nominated and volunteered on several occasions to
            represent my team, group, and the bank in meetings and functions
            held both within and outside the bank, with some of the events held
            in other countries. These experiences have facilitated my rise in
            the banking industry to the level of Assistant Manager before my
            resignation in my home country, Nigeria, and have equipped me with
            relevant tools to excel in the profession even as I embark on a new
            career in Canada.

                combination of theoretical frameworks and practical
